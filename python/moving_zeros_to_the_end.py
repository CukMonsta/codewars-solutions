"""
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end,
preserving the order of the other elements.
"""

# My Answer
def move_zeros(array):
    count_zeros = array.count(0)
    array = [item for item in array if item != 0 or type(item) == bool]
    count_false = array.count(False)
    new_array = [0] * (count_zeros - count_false)
    return array + new_array

# Best Answer
def move_zeros(arr):
    l = [i for i in arr if isinstance(i, bool) or i!=0]
    return l+[0]*(len(arr)-len(l))
